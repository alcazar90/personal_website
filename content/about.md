I'm economic analyst working at Central bank of Chile. I have the ambition to play an interdisciplinary role analysing data, blending artificial intelligence with classic data analysis.

So to achieve this goal I started the mythical journey of self-learning with the help of many online resources and learning by doing.

None mastery was acquiered without consistent practice...so this blog in part have the purpose to be pictures of practice.
