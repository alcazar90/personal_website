I love teaching. I co-created and taught *"Periodismo de Datos"*, an interdisciplinary undergraduate course at Universidad de Chile linking journalism and engineering with data analysis. Mainly about tools to work with data, visualize information and data journalism.

I have experience working in the card payment industry in Chile ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡±, first in a public joint venture fintech. Then during the launch of "CompraquÃ­", a subsidiary of Banco Estado, that gives payment solutions focused on small and medium enterprises with the mission of increasing financial inclusion in the country.

Previously I worked in the macroeconomic statistics area at the Central Bank of Chile.
