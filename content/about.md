I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/alkzar90) non-fiction and novel books.

Enthusiast and autodidact about computer science.

I love teaching. I co-created and taught "Periodismo de Datos", an interdisciplinary course at Universidad de Chile between journalist and engineers about data analysis. Mainly about tools to work with data and visualize information.

I'm currently with a public card payment processing company that his goal is increase financial inclusive. Previously I worked on macroeconomic statistics area at the Central Bank of Chile.
