Enthusiast and autodidact about computer science.

I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/alkzar90) non-fiction and novel books.

I love teaching. I co-created and taught "Periodismo de Datos", an interdisciplinary undergraduate course at Universidad de Chile linking journalism and engineering with data analysis. Mainly about tools to work with data and to visualize information.

I'm currently working at a public card-payment-processing company which vision is to increase financial inclusion. Previously I worked in macroeconomic statistics area at the Central Bank of Chile.

I wrote a chapter about digital literacy and computational thinking for the book *Inteligencia Artificial y Bienestar de las Juventudes en América Latina*. You can read it [here (page 127-135)](https://blogs.harvard.edu/conectadosalsur/2019/12/14/ya-disponible-libro-inteligencia-artificial-y-bienestar-de-las-juventudes-en-america-latina/).
