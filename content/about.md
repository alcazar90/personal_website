I'm a data analyst working at the [Central Bank of Chile](http://www.bcentral.cl/) and I have the ambition to play a role in the field of artificial intelligence. My view is that in the near future data will be the *lingua franca* on a digitized world. For that reason people with different backgrounds need to contribute on how world is changing and this requires an interdisciplinary set of skills.

So to achieve this goal I adopted a *learning by doing approach* and I became a self learning monk with the help of many online resources and cups of tea.

None mastery is acquiered without deliberative and consistent practice, as Peter Norvig said in his post [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)...so this blog have the purpose to left a trail of my learning,  help my future self and to communicate ideas and projects.
