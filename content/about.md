I love teaching. I co-created and taught *"Periodismo de Datos"*, an interdisciplinary undergraduate course at Universidad de Chile linking journalism and engineering with data analysis. Mainly about tools to work with data, visualize information and data journalism.

I have experience working during the openness phase in the card payment industry in Chile ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡±, first in a public-private joint venture. Then during the launch of the payment's subsidiary of Banco Estado, focused on giving payment solutions for small and medium enterprises with the mission of increasing financial inclusion in the country.

Previously I worked in the Macroeconomic Statistics area at the Central Bank of Chile.


I wrote a chapter about digital literacy and computational thinking for the book *Inteligencia Artificial y Bienestar de las Juventudes en AmÃ©rica Latina*.
