Enthusiast and autodidact about computer science.

I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/alkzar90) non-fiction and novel books.

I love teaching. I co-created and taught "Periodismo de Datos", an interdisciplinary undergraduate course at Universidad de Chile between journalism and engineering about data analysis. Mainly about tools to work with data and to visualize information.

I'm currently working at a public card-payment-processing company which vision is to increase financial inclusion. Previously I worked in macroeconomic statistics area at the Central Bank of Chile.
