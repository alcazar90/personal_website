I'm broadly interested in Data Science related topics such as machine learning, computer vision, privacy-preserving machine learning, explainable AI, and information visualization. 
Student at <a href="https://twitter.com/tokyods?s=21)" target="_blank">@TokyoDS</a> (now <a href="https://acalonia.com/acalonia-school" target="_blank">@acalonia_n</a>).

In my free time, I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/alkzar90" target="_blank">read</a> sci-fi, non-fiction and novels.

I like <a href="https://github.com/alcazar90/TidyTuesday" target="_blank">Data Visualization</a>. I co-created, collaborate, and then taught the course called <a href="https://icei.uchile.cl/noticias/147128/finaliza-con-exito-el-primer-curso-interdisciplinario-con-estudiant" target="_blank">Data Journalism</a> at the University of Chile, which brought
engineering and journalism students together to use data science tools to create
data narratives on social issues using data visualizations.

I have experience working during the openness phase in the card payment industry in
Chile, first in a public-private joint venture. Then during the launch of the
payment's subsidiary of a public bank, focused on giving payment solutions for small
and medium enterprises with the mission of increasing financial inclusion in the
country.

Previously, I worked in the Macroeconomic Statistics area at the Central Bank of Chile.

I believe that computational fluency is an essential skill. I wrote a chapter about digital literacy and computational thinking for the book *Inteligencia Artificial y Bienestar de las Juventudes en América Latina*. You can read it <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/conectadosalsur/2019/12/14/ya-disponible-libro-inteligencia-artificial-y-bienestar-de-las-juventudes-en-america-latina/" target="_blank">here (page 127-135)</a>.
