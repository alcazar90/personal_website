I'm economic analyst working at [Central bank of Chile](http://www.bcentral.cl/). I have the ambition to play an interdisciplinary role analysing data, blending artificial intelligence with classic data analysis.

So to achieve this goal I started the mythical journey of self-learning with the help of many online resources and learning by doing.

None mastery is acquiered without deliberative and consistent practice as Peter Norvig say in his post [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)...so this blog in part have the purpose to be engine and pictures of practice.
