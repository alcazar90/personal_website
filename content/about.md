I'm a data analyst working at the [Central Bank of Chile](http://www.bcentral.cl/). I have the ambition to play an interdisciplinary role blending artificial intelligence with classic data analysis.

So to achieve this goal I taken a learning by doing approach and I became a self learning monk with the help of many online resources and cups of tea.

None mastery is acquiered without deliberative and consistent practice, as Peter Norvig said in his post [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)...so this blog have the purpose to left a trail of my learning.
