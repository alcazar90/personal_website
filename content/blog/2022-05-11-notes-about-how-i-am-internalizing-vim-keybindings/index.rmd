**To my future self:**

My learning process using VIM key bindings was stuck on move commands; even though
I realized the power of moving freely and accurately around the editor, I hadn't
reason to waste my life with key bindings. This post is a never-ending excuse to
continue developing my VIM workflow. If I am reading this now, I am sure I forgot
something.


### Repeating a `char` or a `seq` of chars `n` times

**Sequence**: `ESC`-`n`-`i`-`char/seq`-`ESC`-`ESC`

* `n`: number of times
* `i`: insert mode
* `char/seq`: char or sequence of chars

**Usage:** Create a header for a file or when I need to repeat an arbitrary sequence
of characters.
