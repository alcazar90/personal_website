**To my future self:**

My learning process using VIM key bindings was stuck on move commands; even though
I realized the power of moving freely and accurately around the editor, I haven't
a reason to waste my life with key bindings. This post is a never-ending excuse to
continue developing my VIM workflow. If I am reading this now, I am sure I forgot
something.


### Repeating a `char` or a `seq` of chars `n` times

**Sequence**: `ESC`-`n`-`i`-`char/seq`-`ESC`-`ESC`

* `n`: number of times
* `i`: insert mode
* `char/seq`: char or sequence of chars

**Usage:** Create a header for a file or when I need to repeat an arbitrary sequence
of characters.

### Basic replacing in the current line `:s` or in all llines `:%s`

**Sequence**: `:s/this/for that/g` or `:%s/this/for that/g`

* `:s`: is short for "substitute" on the current line
* `:%s`: is short for "substitute" on the whole document
* `this`: is the pattern you want to replace
* `for that`: you want instead
* `g`: is short for "global" and refers to replacing more than the first
occurrence

**Usage:** guess what!

### Change upper-to-lower case and viceversa

**Sequence:** `guu` (upper-to-lower) or `gUU` (lower-to-upper) the current line

* `U`: Change lower-to-upper case
* `u`: Change upper-to-lower case
* VIM selection + {`u` or `U`}: change the selection given `u` or `U` behavior
