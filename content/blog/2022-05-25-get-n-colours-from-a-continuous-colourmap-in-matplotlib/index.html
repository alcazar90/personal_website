<p>During this week, I researched how to discretize a continuous colour palette with matplotlib. I had this problem with doing a data visualization in which I needed a sizeable discrete colour palette (i.e.Â 20). So, the solution is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14779462/5843243" target="_blank">easily findable on the web</a> if youâ€™ve dealt with colourmaps in the past. However, I want to wrap up the why of the problem and how to solve it.</p>

<p>The above visualization shows 20 different lines that exhibit a clearly
convergence rate pattern between the hyperparameter <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> and some
performance measure such as the log-likelihood.
How can we map the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> values to its specific lines? The natural option
is used colours, but you immediately notice that we have a problem with such large quantity
of different values for <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>. Ok, itâ€™s not really a problem, you can just
designed a <code>custom_palette</code> (e.g.Â <a href="https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer">MetBrewer repo</a>)
and code as follow:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from cycler import cycler
import matplotlib as mpl

custom_palette = [&#39;#hexcode_1&#39;, ..., &#39;#hexcode_20&#39;]
custom_cycler = (cycler(color=custom_palette))
plt.rc(&#39;axes&#39;, prop_cycle=custom_cycler)</code></pre>
<p>If you didnâ€™t know what <a href="https://matplotlib.org/cycler/">Cycler</a> is, it is just a
convenient way that <code>matplotlib</code> provides to iterate for different style options
such as colours, line styles, and others.</p>
<p>But waitâ€¦, there is a constraint here; we want to exhibit a pattern through
the coloursâ€“<em>as we increase the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> the log-likelihood
convergence rate increase as well</em>â€“so we need this notion of a gradient. Look
at the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> values; there are jumping in regular steps of 0.005. That
could be annoying for picking a colourâ€™s sequence because we would have to
be accountable for the regularity between any consecutive colours.</p>
<p>So, a <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.5.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html">continuous colormap</a> (<code>CMAP</code>) solve the previous issue, just we need a way
to discretize and pick <code>N=20</code> colours.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>cmap = plt.get_cmap(CMAP, N)
custom_palette = [mpl.colors.rgb2hex(cmap(i)) for i in range(cmap.N)]</code></pre>
<p>Can we do better? Yes! It is possible to decouple the precision from the colour mapping
to each of the 20-labels by highlighting particular lines (e.g.Â best, worst)
using annotations. Then use a colourbar to communicate the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>â€™s effect on the
convergence rate as its value increases. The visualization will be way cleaner
than the above visualization with two columns of labels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/70192912/5843243" target="_blank">trick</a>
is done by <code>ScalerMappable</code> and requires passing two elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A <code>cmap</code> that can we recover from our custom_palette <code>ListedColormap(custom_palette)</code>
or using directly the original (â€˜RdBuâ€™ in this case)</li>
<li>A boundary on each discrete colour in the colourbar using <code>BoundaryNorm</code> that
takes two inputs: the list and length of values (i.e.Â different <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> values)</li>
</ol>
<pre class="python"><code>from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap, BoundaryNorm
from matplotlib.cm import ScalarMappable

cbar = plt.colorbar(ScalarMappable(norm=BoundaryNorm(learning_rates, 
                                                     ncolors=len(learning_rates)), 
                                   cmap=ListedColormap(custom_palette)));
cbar.ax.tick_params(labelsize=7) </code></pre>
