During this week, I researched how to discretize a continuous colour palette with matplotlib. I had this problem with doing a data visualization in which I needed a sizeable discrete colour palette (i.e. 20). So, the solution is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14779462/5843243" target="_blank">easily findable on the web</a> if you've dealt with colourmaps in the past. However, I want to wrap up the why of the problem and how to solve it.

The above visualization shows 20 different lines that exhibit a clearly
convergence rate pattern between the hyperparameter $\eta$ and some 
performance measure such as the log-likelihood.
How can we map the $\eta$ values to its specific lines? The natural option
is used colours, but you immediately notice that we have a problem with such large quantity
of different values for $\eta$. Ok, it's not really a problem, you can just
designed a `custom_palette` (e.g. [MetBrewer repo](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer))
and code as follow:

```python
from cycler import cycler
import matplotlib as mpl

custom_palette = ['#hexcode_1', ..., '#hexcode_20']
custom_cycler = (cycler(color=custom_palette))
plt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=custom_cycler)
```

If you didn't know what [Cycler](https://matplotlib.org/cycler/) is, it is just a
convenient way that `matplotlib` provides to iterate for different style options
such as colours, line styles, and others.

But waitâ€¦, there is a constraint here; we want to exhibit a pattern through
the colours--_as we increase the magnitude of $\eta$ the log-likelihood
convergence rate increase as well_--so we need this notion of a gradient. Look
at the $\eta$ values; there are jumping in regular steps of 0.005. That
could be annoying for picking a colour's sequence because we would have to
be accountable for the regularity between any consecutive colours.

So, a [continuous colormap](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) (`CMAP`) solve the previous issue, just we need a way
to discretize and pick `N=20` colours.

```python
cmap = plt.get_cmap(CMAP, N)
custom_palette = [mpl.colors.rgb2hex(cmap(i)) for i in range(cmap.N)]
```

Can we do better? Yes! It is possible to decouple the precision from the colour mapping
to each of the 20-labels by highlighting particular lines (e.g. best, worst)
using annotations. Then use a colourbar to communicate the $\eta$'s effect on the
convergence rate as its value increases. The visualization will be way cleaner
than the above visualization with two columns of labels.

The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/70192912/5843243" target="_blank">trick</a> 
is done by `ScalerMappable` and requires passing two elements:

1. A `cmap` that can we recover from our custom_palette `ListedColormap(custom_palette)`
or using directly the original ('RdBu' in this case)
1. A boundary on each discrete colour in the colourbar using `BoundaryNorm` that
takes two inputs: the list and length of values (i.e. different $\eta$ values)

```python
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap, BoundaryNorm
from matplotlib.cm import ScalarMappable

cbar = plt.colorbar(ScalarMappable(norm=BoundaryNorm(learning_rates, 
                                                     ncolors=len(learning_rates)), 
                                   cmap=ListedColormap(custom_palette)));
cbar.ax.tick_params(labelsize=7) 
```
