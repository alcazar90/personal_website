</a></p>
<p>I use many Google Colab notebooks, which are great for experimentation and sharing your deep learning projects with others. Not being required to set up the python environment makes it much easier to open the notebook and start to figure out what is there or jump directly into working on your problem. Also, if you‚Äôre working on a Deep Learning problem, you will undoubtedly require GPU computation; Colab provides you with a free usage quota. Exporting into a standard Jupyter notebook is trivial if you want to start a GitHub repository and move the notebook there. In a nutshell, it‚Äôs an excellent tool to prototype for small to mid-size projects and create tutorials or other learning artefacts to share with others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, two points start to provoke friction in the google collab advantages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Experimenting with your custom dataset challenges reproducibility and makes collaboration harder.</li>
<li>Training or fine-tuning a model involves running multiple times and changing hyperparameters many times; things start to be a mess, and tracking your experiments in the notebook is using the knife as a fork.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two open-source tools that I started to use to alleviate both problems and keep the advantages at their total capacity: <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index" target="_blank">Hugging Face Datasets</a> and <a href="https://wandb.ai/site" target="_blank">Weights &amp; Biases</a>. Moreover, I will discuss how these tools can allow you to transition from a project notebook approach into a deep learning repository with the respective python modules and a command line interface for running your experiments wherever you want.</p>
<div id="example-project-fine-tuning-an-image-segmentation-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Example Project: fine-tuning an image segmentation model</h3>
<p>I will use a project I started on fine-tuning an image segmentation model (i.e.¬†<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15203" target="_blank">SegFormer</a>) in cell images from a high-throughput microscope üî¨. The idea is to train a model using cell shots with mask labels that denote the ones alive. A good model can connect directly to the microscope and help scientists detect cells quickly affected by a given treatment.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>We are talking about reproducibility and collaboration so that you can follow the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tCN__7HxJ61WFUm14kr6ziloNaOH9Def?usp=sharing" target="_blank">google collab notebook</a> with the project in the banner at the start of the post. The notebook has three sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Image Segmentation Walkthrough with SegFormer üì∏: model usage on their specific domain task and how the dataset interacts with them.</li>
<li>Training + Weights &amp; Biases experiment tracking ü™Ñ + üêù: the training dynamic, hyperparameters, and experiment tracking using Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B).</li>
<li>Training script via command line üöÄ: a section to experiment with different model configurations using a training script.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the three sections follow the development of the project. First, we will understand how to use the model and the dataset manipulation to feed it. Second, once the data flow through the model, we start working in training, what we want to track and record, and the hyperparameters configurations such as the learning rate and batch size. The two initial sections work as an internal exploration and as documentation for anyone who wants to understand the project. The third and last one is engineering effort to make life easier and get the job done.</p>

<h3>Hugging Face Datasets</h3>
<p>Who doesn‚Äôt have to run a tutorial using the MNIST dataset with PyTorch? If you haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs straightforward and fast. That makes sense; you don‚Äôt want to spend time getting the MNIST data and running boilerplate code every time; you want to focus on learning a new model or concept.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import torchvision.datasets as datasets
MNISt=datasets.MNIST(root=&#39;./data&#39;, train=True, download=True, transform=None)</code></pre>
<p>I don‚Äôt mean that data doesn‚Äôt matter. At some point, we want to pack the data to iterate quickly in our model development workflow. In the same spirit that is getting MNIST from PyTorch, we want the data in a central repository, ready to consume and easy to share. We can get these three features for free using the Hugging Face dataset repository.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Figure 2, we have a picture of the dataset repository of the example
project, a page where you have a preview and documentation of the data. There is also a
<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/cell_benchmark/tree/main" target="_blank">repository for storing images, text, or other data you have</a>. There is no limit size for the data storage reported in the documentation. Still, I created a repository that stored the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/NIH-Chest-X-ray-dataset" target="_blank">NIH Chest X-ray dataset</a> (&gt; 40gb) without problems, and there are datasets with terabytes of memory. The purpose of investing time in creating a repository for your dataset is that you will have a python module for downloading and loading the data in the same fashion that <a href="https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html" target="_blank"><code>torchvision.datasets</code></a> provides you with the MNIST and
others benchmark datasets. Below you can see how we load the dataset for the cell segmentation example project:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from datasets import load_dataset

repo_name = &quot;alkzar90/cell_benchmark&quot;
train_ds = load_dataset(repo_name, split=&quot;train&quot;, streaming=False)
val_ds = load_dataset(repo_name, split=&quot;validation&quot;, streaming=False) 
test_ds = load_dataset(repo_name, split=&quot;test&quot;, streaming=False) </code></pre>
<p>How does Hugging Face know how the dataset load (i.e.¬†read files, split the data)?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The module supports <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to" target="_blank">common data types</a> by default, such as tabular, images, text, audio, etc. You need to follow a template for storing the dataset organized, like <a href= "https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder.html" target="_blank"><code>torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder</code></a> approach (i.e.¬†data_split/label/image_001.jpg), and the Hugging Face dataset module figures out how to load.</li>
<li>Sometimes you must accommodate multiple datatypes (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/CC6204-Hackaton-Cub-Dataset" target="_blank">CUB 200 2011 dataset</a>), or you want to provide different configuration of the dataset for various tasks such as image classification and object detection (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/rock-glacier-dataset" target="_blank">in the dataset preview rock glacier dataset, notice the data subset option</a>), or your dataset type lacks default support by the library. In this case, you must write a custom python (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/cell_benchmark/blob/main/cell_benchmark.py" target="_blank">simple example</a> / <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/NIH-Chest-X-ray-dataset/blob/main/NIH-Chest-X-ray-dataset.py" target="_blank">complex example</a>) loader script to tell the module how to navigate the file structure, deal with data and labels.</li>
</ol>
<p>The datasets repository works similarly to a GitHub repo. You can get version code and data with commits, collaborate with others via pull requests and have README for general dataset documentation. There is also support for <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_arrow" target="_blank">apache arrow format</a> to get the data in streaming mode; when the data is too heavy to load at once, you can download, and via the caching system, you can load batches on demand in memory.</p>

<div id="experiment-tracking-with-wb" class="section level3">
<h3>Experiment tracking with W&amp;B</h3>
<p>Weight &amp; Biases (W&amp;B or <code>wandb</code>) provides free services for logging information about your project into a web server that you can monitor from a dashboard. It‚Äôs helpful to think of your W&amp;B project as a database with tools for interacting with your experiment information.</p>
<p>Once you have a W&amp;B account, you can create a project such as <a href="https://wandb.ai/alcazar90/cell-segmentation" target="_blank">alcazar90/cell-segmentation</a> to log the information from each experiment you run. In section 2 of the google colab, sub-section ‚Äúü¶æ Run experiment‚Äù, you initialize a run with <code>wandb.init</code> providing the following arguments: (i.) name of the project and (ii.) a config dictionary that provides context about your experimentation such as number of epochs, batch size, etc. Also, you can give a name for identify run, but if you don‚Äôt, W&amp;B create random expressions such as resplendent-rocket-27 or abundant-moon-38 (yes, the number is the experiment number). Commonly, there will be a lot of runs in your project because when you get a taste of the improvements in the way you log information, the ideas you want to try increase.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>PROJECT = &#39;cell-segmentation&#39;
wandb.init(project=PROJECT, config={&quot;epochs&quot;: EPOCHS, &quot;batch_size&quot;: BS, &quot;lr&quot;: LR,
                                    &quot;lr_scheduler_exponential__gamma&quot;: GAMMA, 
                                    &quot;seed&quot;: SEED})

# Add additional configs to wandb if needed
wandb.config[&#39;len_train&#39;] = len(datasets.train_ds)
wandb.config[&#39;len_val&#39;] = len(datasets.valid_ds)</code></pre>
<p>For example, you can see the config information in the dashboard from the run <code>auspicious-paper-44</code> in the <a href="https://wandb.ai/alcazar90/cell-segmentation/runs/goqt0zp7/overview?workspace=user-alcazar90" target="_blank">overview option at the left menu</a>. There is a table describing the context of this experiment (mostly hyperparameters settings):</p>

</center>
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p>After initializing a run and logging the config, we want to log information during the model training. Typically we want to track the main metrics in the train and validation set; these will be floating points across time that we log using <code>wandb.log</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for epoch in tqdm(range(EPOCHS)):
  ...
  metrics = {&quot;train/train_loss&quot;: train_loss, 
               &quot;train/epoch&quot;: (step + 1 + (n_steps_per_epoch * epoch)) / n_steps_per_epoch, 
               &quot;train/example_ct&quot;: example_ct,
               &quot;train/cur_learning_rate&quot;: scheduler.state_dict()[&quot;_last_lr&quot;][0]}
  ...
  val_metrics = {&quot;val/val_loss&quot;: val_loss, 
                 &quot;val/val_accuracy&quot;: accuracy,
                 &quot;val/mIoU&quot;: mIoU}
  wandb.log({**metrics, **val_metrics})</code></pre>
<p>W&amp;B knows how to display these metrics, so it makes charts for you automatically in the run‚Äôs dashboard.</p>

<p>Beyond the obvious things to log, such as training and validation loss, you can log whatever you want. In Figure 5, I log information from the dev set into a <a href="https://wandb.ai/stacey/mnist-viz/reports/Guide-to-W-B-Tables--Vmlldzo2NTAzOT" target="_blank">wand.Table</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual image and mask.</li>
<li>The predicted mask.</li>
<li>The probability map (it‚Äôs so cool).</li>
<li>The intersection over union metric for individual examples.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="python"><code># üêù Create a wandb Table to log images, labels and predictions to
table = wandb.Table(columns=[&quot;image&quot;, &quot;mask&quot;, &quot;pred_mask&quot;, &quot;probs&quot;, &quot;iou&quot;])
for img, mask, pred, prob, iou_metric in zip(images.to(&quot;cpu&quot;), masks.to(&quot;cpu&quot;), predicted.to(&quot;cpu&quot;), probs.to(&quot;cpu&quot;), iou_by_example.to(&quot;cpu&quot;)):
    plt.imshow(prob.detach().cpu());
    plt.axis(&quot;off&quot;);
    plt.tight_layout();
    table.add_data(
      wandb.Image(img.permute(1,2,0).numpy()), 
      wandb.Image(mask.view(img.shape[1:]).unsqueeze(2).numpy()),
      wandb.Image(np.uint8(pred.unsqueeze(2).numpy())*255),
      wandb.Image(plt),
      iou_metric)</code></pre>
<p>Observe from the code that <code>wand.Table</code> has image columns that we add using <code>wand.Image</code> and requires numpy arrays as input, but you can also log plots created with matplotlib, like in the case of the probability column. These allow us to have tables with rendered images as values that we can inspect quickly. This feature is convenient as a complement to traditional metrics. However, for image-generative models, checking the pictures you generated by the model during training gives you more information about your model than tracking the loss.</p>
<p>Finally, on your project‚Äôs main page, in the ‚ÄúTable‚Äù option at the left menu, you have a bird-eye view of all runs and their metrics to compare. You can export this info into a csv file or download it by API to analyze.</p>

<div id="training-script-via-command-line" class="section level3">
<h3>Training script via command line üöÄ</h3>
<p>In the last section, we saw how to integrate W&amp;B to log information about our model training. Still, fine-tuning a model or training from scratch requires a lot of experimentation. The idea is to iterate and try many configurations. Indeed, you can do this in the notebook, but doing it that way is redundant and non-optimal: <em>think about re-running every time the code cells after you change the batch size in your data loaders</em>. The next step is to wrap all the code cells required to train your model into a <strong>training script</strong>, such as downloading the dataset, creating the data loaders, importing utility functions, and setting hyperparameters and training configurations.</p>
<p>Wrapping the code into a training script, plus using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html"><code>argparse</code></a> module, you will unlock the achievement to call the training script directly from the command line:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>!python finetune_model.py --train_batch_size 4 --validation_batch_size 3\
     --init_learning_rate 3e-4 --learning_rate_scheduler_gamma 0.92\
     --num_train_epochs 15 --reproducibility_seed 42313988\
     --log_images_in_validation True --dataloader_num_workers 0\
     --model_name &quot;huggingface-segformer-nvidia-mit-b0&quot;\
     --project_name &quot;cell-segmentation&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/alcazar90/cell-segmentation/blob/main/finetune_model.py" target="_blank">training script here</a>, but the main heavy work is done by the argparse module, in which you can define a parser protocol to define and read the parameters for running the script via the command line. The idea is as follows:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import argparse 

def parse_args(input_args=None):
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&quot;Training loop script for fine-tune a pretrained SegFormer model.&quot;)
  
  parser.add_argument(
    &quot;--train_batch_size&quot;, type=int, default=4, help=&quot;Batch size (per device) for
    the training dataloader&quot;
  )
  ...</code></pre>
<p>Until now, I developed the entire code project in google colab, created a Hugging Face dataset repository, and integrated W&amp;B to log the model training information. But the project doesn‚Äôt have any home in GitHub.</p>
<p>When it‚Äôs necessary a code repository for the project? It depends; for example, if creating the dataset requires pre-processing scripts and tests, keeping all those files in a GitHub repository makes sense. Regardless, the moment we develop the training script, creating a GitHub repository for the training script and its dependencies is a good decision. We want to make the training script accessible, even for us. In the last section of the google colab notebook, I downloaded the training script from the GitHub repo to train using the computation provided by colab.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alcazar90/cell-segmentation/main/finetune_model.py</code></pre>
<p>Side actions to do with your repo: upload a jupyter notebook version of the colab and write a nice readme to provide context.</p>
