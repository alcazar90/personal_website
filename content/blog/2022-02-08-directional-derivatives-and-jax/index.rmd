Directional derivatives are the conceptual tool to measure the effect on a
function by changing the input in any direction within the input space. It's
possible to compute the directional derivatives using the jacobian-vector
product, implemented by the automatic differentiation JAX library.

Partial derivatives $\partial f/ \partial x_i$ give us the rate of change if
we slightly modify the *ith element* of the input vector $\bf{x}$ letting the
rest constant.

<br>

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} = lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_1 + h, x_2, \dots, x_n) - f({\bf x})}{h}
\\
\vdots
\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} = lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n + h) - f({\bf x})}{h}
$$

<br>

The above definition can be more compactly using vector notation.

<br>

$$
\nabla_{{\bf x}}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial {\bf x}} = lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f({\bf x} + h{\bf e_i}) - f({\bf x})}{h}
$$
<br>
The $e_i$ vector represents a unit vector in the direction of $i$.

As you can see in the initial diagram, in a 2D input space, there are two
partial derivatives:

- $\partial f / \partial x$: computing parallel to the x-axis ($e_1$ *typical known as* $\hat{i}$) 
- $\partial f / \partial y$: computing parallel to the y-axis ($e_2$ *typical known as* $\hat{j}$). 

Computing derivatives using unit vectors such as $e_i$ give us the change of
$f$ on the direction on $i$, or parallel to the *i-axis*. How can we compute
the derivative of $f$ given a slight nudge of the inputs in any arbitrary
direction?

Directional derivatives is a way to compute the rate of change on $f$ in the
direction of ${\bf v}$.

<br>
$$
\nabla_{{\bf v}}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial {\bf x}} = lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f({\bf x} + h{\bf v}) - f({\bf x})}{h}
$$
<br>

Think as ${\bf v}$ as a weighted vector of the *n-directions* of the input
space. We aren't limited to the changes on $f$ in parallel directions in the input space.

We can compute directional derivatives using the dot product between the 
jacobian vector ($\nabla f$) and the vector ${\bf v}$. For instance, for a two-dimensional input space, ${\bf v}= (v_1, v_2)$:

$$\nabla f_{v} = \nabla f \cdot {\bf v} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} v_1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}v_2$$

More general:

$$\nabla f_{{\bf v}}(p) = \nabla f(p) \cdot {\bf v} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(p) v_i$$

Let's focus on computing the above using the function `jax.jvp`, which `jvp`
stands for the *jacobian-vector product*.

The function `jax.jvp` computes the directional derivative and whose arguments are:

1. A differentiable function $f$ for compute the jacobian $\nabla f$
1. A primal vector ${\bf p}$ to evaluate the jacobian $\nabla f(p)$
1. A tangent vector ${\bf v}$ which represent the direction in which we 
want to calculate the derivative.

`jax.jvp` returns a tuple with $(f(p), \nabla f_{v}(p))$

### Example

We compute the directional derivative of $f(x, y)=x^2y$ hand-coding all the 
necessary elements and then check the results that give `jax.jvp`.

```python
def fun(x, y): return x**2 * y
def fun_dx(x, y): return 2*x*y
def fun_dy(x, y): return x**2
```

We define the primal vector ${\bf p}$ and the tangent vector ${\bf v}$
in which we want to compute the directional derivative.

```python
p = [1., 1.]
v = [1., 2.]
```
Evaluate $f(p)$:

```python
# *n-list/n-tuple unpack the element e0, e1, ..., en
fun(*p)
> 1.0
```

Compute the directional derivative using the `fun_dx` and `fun_dy`.

```python
fun_dx(*p) * v[0] + fun_dy(*p) * v[1]
> 4.0
```
Now using `jax.jvp` we obtain the same results: $f({\bf p})$ and $\nabla_{\bf v}f({\bf p})$.

```python
jax.jvp(fun, p, v)
> (DeviceArray(1., dtype=float32, weak_type=True),
   DeviceArray(4., dtype=float32, weak_type=True))
```

Let's plot the example and compute the directional derivatives for three
points.

Look the directional vectors in the plot, or tangent vector as JAX refers to the
them, there are of different lengths. It's important to remark that if we want
the ["slope definition"](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivative-and-gradient-articles/a/directional-derivative-introduction?modal=1) for directional derivatives we
need to transform ${\bf v}$ in a unit length vector. Remember that partial
derivatives are computing using unit vectors ($e_i$).


$$
\nabla_{{\bf v}}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial {\bf x}} = lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f({\bf x} + h{\bf v}) - f({\bf x})}{h||{\bf v}||}
$$

primal_c = jnp.array([0., 0.])
va = jnp.array([-7.5, 5.7])
vb = jnp.array([7.5, -5.7])
vc = jnp.array([-1.0, -0.7])
unit_va = va/va.dot(va)**.5
unit_vb = vb/vb.dot(vb)**.5
unit_vc = vc/vc.dot(vc)**.5
# computing with scaling the directionl vectors

   DeviceArray(-40.60427, dtype=float32, weak_type=True),

- Point A (blue): the directional derivative is 40.6, making sense with the contour lines in front of point A. The surface starter to rise in the direction of $\overrightarrow{v}_a$.
- Point B (red): the function ùëì decrease in the direction pointing out the vector $\overrightarrow{v}_b$, like the directional derivative, ùëì changes ‚àí40.6 regard slightly input variations across the directional vector. Notice that it has the same magnitude as the slope of point A but goes in the opposite direction; the surface plot shows how the function increases/decreases in the same proportion across its diagonals.
- Point C (black): the surface is practically flat around the point (0,0). Notice that the directional derivative at $\overrightarrow{v}_c$ is 0.
