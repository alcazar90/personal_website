<p>Data wrangling refer to the process to map raw data to a format more suitable to model, visualize or in general to work with it. This process is usually thinking as an early stage of the data analysis pipeline. But can required in other different stages, so a good data wrangling skills is a must to the data analysis process.</p>
<p>So, for other side, data in real life isn’t always friendly. Data can take different formats and also many people (or institutions) share the data in not the most “shareable” format. One of these types of formats are the spreadsheets kind.</p>
