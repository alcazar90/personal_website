It is not difficult to find a relationship between two variables when there is not.
We may observe a negative correlation between variables, but the actual correlation
between them is positive, or vice versa. Many times this phenomenon is explained
by Berkson's paradox.

When we are talking about correlation is simply refers to the measure of the 
relationship between two variables. A [correlation](https://brilliant.org/wiki/correlation/)
measures the grade in which two variables are associated linearly. It can take a
value that goes from -1 to 1, in which -1 means a perfect negative linear
relationship: more $X$ is associate with less $Y$, or vice-versa. Conversely, a 
correlation equal to 1 means that more $X$ is associated with more $Y$. Finally, 
a 0 correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$ is interpreted as no relationship at all.

It is essential to acknowledge the differences between what we observed and the
truth or what it is. In our daily lives, we are surrounded by plenty of scenarios
in which we don't think about the sample size or if groups are well represented
within the sample. The thing is that we look at the world through 
our kaleidoscope, full of patterns, full of colours.

Imagine that you start thinking about the relationship between attractiveness and 
sympathy...and you begin inferring by your own dates experiences and stories of 
your fine selection of friends that handsome people are jerks; meanwhile,
enjoyable people are not so good looking. 

Why it's so common to hear this? Are attractiveness and niceness put in conflict 
by our creators? It is widespread to hear from the popular wisdom library such a 
conundrum, but we don't have many reasons to believe any relationship between
these attributes. Indeed, both variables, in reality, correlate near to 0. But
what could it explain this apparent contradiction between the observed and the
"truth"?  Berkson's Paradox!

Let's say that $X$ = "Niceness" and $Y$ = "Attractiveness". Then we collect data from
many people, measuring these attributes, which you can visualize in the below animation.
Every attribute has a score from 0 to 100; the former means absent and the later
fullness of the attribute, respectively. Note that in the animation title, you 
can see the correlation coefficient ($\rho$).

It's likely and honest to think that, on average, one restricts the potential
candidates in which we are interested in getting a date. You accept to date with
someone who is not so good-looking if their eloquent and lovely behaviour
compensates the absence of visual gracefulness. Otherwise, you could tolerate an
idiot in the way in which their handsomeness diminished its jerkiness fragrance.
As you can appreciate, from the above animation, your preferences remove from the 
map the group of candidates who don't meet your minimum criteria. Let's call this 
group "You would not date".

Now the ugly truth: another group would use similar arguments to avoid our perfect
combination of attractiveness and niceness, which we call "Would not date you".
This double mechanism of restrictions prevents us from "observed the world as it
is" and explain how we go from a correlation close to 0 between attractiveness and
niceness to a strong negative correlation of −0.7: *the more handsome you are,
the more jerkiness you spit out*. An illusion of our kaleidoscope that gives us the
impression of a false dichotomy between $X$ and $Y$.

the tool [Animated Gif Maker](https://ezgif.com/maker).
