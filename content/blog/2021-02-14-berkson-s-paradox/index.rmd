Many times we are in presence of two variables which they don't have a
relationship at all. Let say, $X$ and $Y$, but we observed both
variables together could indicate just the opposite, that indeed variables are
correlated. Maybe also we observed a negative correlation
between variables but, actually, the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ is positive.
This kind of cases most of the time could be explained by Berkson's paradox.

Let's think about the idea while we observed $X$ and $Y$ without taking much care or
attention in the way we observed, i.e. without thinking about which size of the
sample is necessary to draw significant conclusions or consider if different
groups across the sample are well represented. In our daily lives, we are
surrounded by plenty of these scenarios in which we are looking through an
"observational lens", a kind of kaleidoscope whose beautiful and crazy patterns
have effects on how $X$ and $Y$ are related. When the kaleidoscope influences
the observation itself inducing our belief about the association, we are in 
presence of a bias called *selection bias*.

Before jump into an example, its necessary to understand what I mean by $X$ and
$Y$ are associated or related. The
[correlation](https://brilliant.org/wiki/correlation/){target="_blank"} ($\rho$)
is a metric that measures the grade of a relationship between two variables. In
general, a correlation measure the grade in which two variables are associated
linearly. It's a metric that
goes from -1 to 1, in which -1 means a perfect negative linear relationship: *more*
$X$ *is associate with less* $Y$*, or vice-versa*. A correlation of 1 is just the 
opposite: *more* $X$ *is associate with more* $Y$ *and vice-versa*. Finally, when $X$ 
couldn't be associated with more or less $Y$, we said that the correlation
between variables is 0, so there isn't a linear relationship involved at all.

Imagine that you came up with an idea of how niceness and attractiveness are related, our $X=Niceness$ and $Y=Attractiveness$. This relationship was inferred
by your own dates experiences and from the stories of your fine selection of
friends. This is the kaleidoscope we referred to before, in which we deduce the idea of how attributes are associated just from the information around us without any concern.
Sorry about the apparent banality of the example, but I promise that it's a
very good one to illustrate the concept.
You can find this example better explained and a lot of other interesting things
in the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48889983-calling-bullshit" target="_blank">Calling Bullshit (Bergstrom, West, 2020)</a>
Ok...let's back to the point. it’s really common to hear from the popular wisdom
library that handsome people are jerks or people who are enjoyable they're not
usually attractive at all, but...why it’s so common to hear this?  Who is
responsible to put in conflict attractiveness and niceness? The truth is that we
don't have many reasons to believe any relationship between these attributes,
indeed both variables, in reality, correlate near to 0. But what could it
explain this apparent contradiction? Berkson's Paradox!

Below we have an animation of a scatterplot in what we measure each attribute
from 0 to 100, i.e. for the absent to the plentifully of the attribute.
In the title, you can see the correlation ($\rho$) of the current state.

It's likely and honest to think that on average one restrict the potential
candidates in which we are interested to get a date. You accept to date with
someone who is not so good-looking if her or his eloquent and nice behaviour 
compensate the absence of visual gracefulness. Otherwise, you could tolerate an
idiot in the way in her or his handsomeness diminished its jerkiness fragrance.
As you can appreciate, from the above animation, your kaleidoscope removes from
the map the group of candidates who don't meet your minimal criteria, let's call
this group "You would not date". 

Unfortunately, there is another group who would use similar arguments to avoid
our perfect combination of attractiveness and niceness and which we call "Would
not date you". This double mechanism of restrictions prevent us from
"observed the world as it is" and explain how we go from a correlation close
to $0$ between attractiveness and niceness to a strong negative correlation of 
$-0.7$. The illusion of the kaleidoscope gives us the impression of a
false dichotomy between these two variables.

The gif made by mounting three different plots created with ggplot2 (R) and using
the tool [Animated Gif Maker](https://ezgif.com/maker).
