<p>Many times we are in presence of two variables which they don’t have a
relationship at all. Let say, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, but the way in which we observed both
variables together could indicated just the opposite, that indeed variables are
correlated. Maybe also it’s possible that we observed a negative correlation
between variables but actually the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is positive.
This kind of cases most of the time could be explained by Berkson’s paradox.</p>
<p>Lets think in the idea while we observed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> without taking much care or
attention in the way we observed, i.e. without thinking about which size of the
sample is necessary to draw significant conclusions or consider if different
groups across the sample are well represented. In our daily lives we are
surrounded by plenty of these scenarios in which we are looking through an
“observational len”, a kind of kaleidoscope whose beautiful and crazy patterns
have effects about how <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are related. When the kaleidoscope influence
the observation itself inducing our belief about the association, we are in
presence of a bias called <em>selection bias</em>.</p>
<p>Before jump into an example, it’s important to understand what I mean by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are associated or related. The
<a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/correlation/" target="_blank">correlation</a> (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>)
is a metric that measure the grade of a relationship between two variables. In
general, correlation measure the grade in which two variables are associated
linearly. It’s a metric that
go from -1 to 1, in which -1 means a perfect negative linear relationship: <em>more</em>
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <em>is associate with less</em> <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span><em>, or viceversa</em>. A correlation of 1 is just the
opposite: <em>more</em> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <em>is associate with more</em> <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <em>and viceversa</em>. Finally, when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
couldn’t be associated with more or less <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we said that the correlation
between variables is 0, so there aren’t a linear relationship involved at all.</p>
<p>Imagine that you came up with an idea of how niceness and attractiveness are related, our <span class="math inline">\(X=Niceness\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y=Attractiveness\)</span>. This relationship was inferred
by your own dates experiences and from the stories of your fine selection of
friends. This is the kaleidoscope we referred before, in which we deduce the idea of how attributes are associated just from the information around us without any concern.
Sorry about the apparently banality of the example, but I promise that it’s a
very good one for illustrate the concept.
You can find this example better explained and a lot of other interesting things
in the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48889983-calling-bullshit" target="_blank">Calling Bullshit (Bergstrom, West, 2020)</a>
Ok…let’s back to the point. it’s really common to hear from the popular wisdom
library that handsome people are jerks or people who are enjoyable they’re not
usually attractive at all, but…why it’s so common to hear this? Who is
responsible to put in conflict attractiveness and niceness? The truth is that we
don’t have many reasons to believe any relationship between these attributes,
indeed both variables in reality have a correlation near to 0. But what could it
explain this apparent contradiction? Berkson’s Paradox!</p>
<p>Below we have an animation of a scatterplot in what we measure each attribute
from 0 to 100, i.e. for the totally absent to the plentifully of the attribute.
In the title, you can see the correlation (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) of the current state.</p>

<p>It’s likely and honest to think that in average one restrict the potential
candidates in which we are interested to get a date. You accept to date with
someone who is not so good-looking if her or him eloquent and nice behavior
compensate the absent of visual gracefulness. Otherwise, you could tolerate an
idiot in the way in her or him handsomeness diminished its jerkiness fragrance.
As you can appreciate, from the above animation, your kaleidoscope remove from
the map the group of candidates who don’t meet your minimal criteria, lets call
this group “You would not date”.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is another group who would used similar arguments to avoid
our perfect combination of attractiveness and niceness and which we call “Would
not date you”. This double mechanism of restrictions prevent us from
“observed the world as it is” and explain how we go from a correlation close
to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> between attractiveness and niceness to a strong negative correlation of
<span class="math inline">\(-0.7\)</span>. An illusion of the kaleidoscope which gives us the impression of a
false dichotomy between these two variables.</p>
