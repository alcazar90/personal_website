*"It's not about information anymore,* ***it's about curation***." <a href="https://twitter.com/suzatweet?s=21" target="_blank">Suzana IliÄ‡ (MLT)</a> 


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone asked me why we&#39;re organizing DL workshops, since there&#39;s a ton of excellent online resources out there. And I think that&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s not about information anymore, it&#39;s about curation. We are drowning in blog posts, tutorials, courses, repos, docs, papers.</p>&mdash; Suzana IliÄ‡ (@suzatweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/suzatweet/status/1166347201766780928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
