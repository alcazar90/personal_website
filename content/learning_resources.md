*"It's not about information anymore,* ***it's about curation****."* Suzana Ilić.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone asked me why we&#39;re organizing DL workshops, since there&#39;s a ton of excellent online resources out there. And I think that&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s not about information anymore, it&#39;s about curation. We are drowning in blog posts, tutorials, courses, repos, docs, papers.</p>&mdash; Suzana Ilić (@suzatweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/suzatweet/status/1166347201766780928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This section contain a collection of online resources on math, machine learning, computer science and data science tools.


## Math

The [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm) course of the professor Gilbert (MIT).

An [Applied Numerical Computing](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/ee133a.html) course with the open access book [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf).

The [Convex Optimization](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CVX101/Winter2014/info) course of *Stephen Boyd*.

A probability course developed and given by the professor Jonh Tsitsiklis (MIT): [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data.](https://www.edx.org/es/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data-2)


## Machine Learning

A collection of interactive machine learning examples in google colab notebooks: [Seedbank](https://research.google.com/seedbank/)

The Bishop's book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)

A book that provides an introduction to statistical learning methods with application in the R programming language: [An introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) and the [MOOC version of the book.](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) For a more advanced material, [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).

The book [Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models](http://www.feat.engineering/) by *Max Kuhn* and *Kjell Jonhson* gives you tools for representing predictors.


### Neural Networks

[A beginner's Guide to the Mathematics of Neural Networks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.3556&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

[Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Nielsen Open Access Book)](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

## Computer Science

The MIT introductory course on Computer Science and programming using python via EDX:

- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.](https://www.edx.org/es/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11) 

- [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science.](https://www.edx.org/es/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-6)

An open access book about [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html), by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

The [Stanford Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) via coursera, by Tim Roughgarden.

A toolt for visualize code execution, useful to understand algorithms and tricky code steps: [python-tutor](http://pythontutor.com/).

### Data Science tools

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a book that explain you more than a bunch of tools to work with data in R. It gives you a mental model to work in data science projects and a package to implement each part of the model.

A more understanding of the R language, [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by *Hadley Wickham*.

[Fundamental of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/), by *Claus Wilke* gives you a precise mix of theory and practical tips about making great visualizations.

The grammar of graphics is a theory developed by Wilkinson that gives you a practical way to describe a plot. Ggplot2 is an R package that implement this theory and you can learn in the [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) book.

In python, we have the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) library that gives you a declarative visualization tool that works based on the grammar of graphics.
